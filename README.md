# Problem Description

You are required to simulate a popcorn dispenser. The machine can produce a maximum of three popcorn bags at a time. To guarantee high availability, there are two cookers in the dispenser. The cookers produce popcorn bags and place in the output bin. A robot arm picks it up from the output bin and places on the nearby table to be picked up by those who pass by. The robot arm can pick only one popcorn bag at a time.

- Using Java, implement a producer-consumer based solution for this simulation. Your implementation must be multi-threaded. Assume that the data structures that you use do not have in-built concurrency handling ability. You should write a main method to demonstrate the important steps of the given scenario.When the robot arm picks a popcorn bag, a bell must ring, and a light has to blink. Communication between the robot arm, and the light and bell should be implemented using asynchronous event handling. Modify the class corresponding to robot arm to support this functionality and add classes corresponding to Bell and Light.
